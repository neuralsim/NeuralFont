# NeuralFont, an 8-bit scaleable Font

This is a font I created myself, from scratch, because I needed a font with an 8-bit look to it.

It is designed to have an 8-bit look but also scale very well. The characters themselves are 7x7 pixels, and the border between them is 1 pixel. Kerning is of course required to make the font look good. I will add a kerning file eventually once I figure out the right format to use. I suggest you just play with it and develop your own kerning pairs, it's not hard, and it's worth it, the font looks very nice when properly formatted.

I am releasing it into the PUBLIC COMMONS. This means it is completely free for anyone to use, extend, modify, change and even sell. Good luck with that last part.

What you CANNOT do with my font is very simple. You cannot claim it is your own font and nobody else is allowed to use it. I not only created it myself, I have extensive proof that I created it myself, and also proof of when I created it.

This is not legal advice, of course. If you are planning to use this in a commercial product and you want to see my evidence of ownership, contact me.

In short, if anybody sues you and says you stole their font, they're lying. This is an original work of art. Every single pixel in this font was carefully curated. In all this probably took about 8 hours to make and then a couple of months to perfect.

Enjoy!
